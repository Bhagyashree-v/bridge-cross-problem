NAME AND USN:-
            1.BHAGYASHREE V-1KS18CS128
CONTRIBUTIONS:-
        ->problem logic and debugging the code,errosrs cleared,modified the code.
   DEFINTION OF GREEDY ALGORITHM:
                  A GREEDY ALGORITHM IS ANY ALGORITHM THAT FOLLOWS THE PROBLEM SOLVING HEURISTIC OF MAKING THE LOCALLY OPTIMAL CHOICE AT EACH STAGE WITH THE INTENT OF FINDING OPTIMAL SOLUTION.
 
 
 INTRODUCTION OF ASSAIGNMENT:-
 
 A group of "n" people wish to cross a bridge at night time with their individual crossing time.and there is only 1 torch available .A maximum of 2 people can cross the bridge at atime,and they must have torch with them.
       
    EXPLINATION:-
                (for GREEDY APPROACH)=1,2,5,10
                1.person 1 and person 2 goes it takes 2 seconds
                2.person 1 comes back it takes 1 second
                3.person 1 and person 5 goes it takes 5 seconds
                4.person 1 comes back it takes 1 second
                5.person 1 and person 10 goes it takes 10 seconds
                        TOTAL TIME=10+1+5+1+2
                                    =19SECONDS
                                    
                  (for OPTIMAL SOLUTION)
                1.person 1 and person 2 goes it takes 2 seconds
                2.person 1 comes back it takes 1 second
                3.person 5 and person 10 goes it itakes 10 seconds
                4.person 2 comes back it takes 2 seconds
                5.person 1 and person 2 goes it takes 2 seconds
                        TOTAL TIME=2+2+10+1+2
                                    =17SECONDS
                                    
            
            
 INSTRUCTIONS:-
            1.after compiling the logical code
            2.enter the input values which has shown in the above code
            3.keep on changing the values then press ENTER to get the output
 DETAILS OF INPUT AND OUTPUT:-
            1.GREEDY APPROACH
                  INPUT = 1,2,5,10
                  OUTPUT= 19 SECS
            2.OPTIMAL SOLUTION:-
                  INPUT=1,2,5,10
                  OUTPUT=17 SECS
  CHALLENGES FACED:-
  
                      1. caluculate fastest time
                      2.people need to be orderd
                      3.at one time 1 or 2 persons can go
                      4.only one torch sholud be used
   LEARN FROM THIS ASSAIGNMENT:-
                  1.using command line arguments in java
                  2.depth information about greedy approach
                  3.depth information about optimal solution
                  4.learnt how create and debug in java language
     NOTE I HAVE USED intellj IDEA software for desigining the code.
